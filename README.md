Generate exercises, display them in a browser, capture the answer,
evaluate the answer and give feedback on it. This project is to simulate
that process.

The goal is to make an exercise of the type a + b where both a and b are
random numbers. The end user gets this exercise presented in a web
browser and can submit an answer. The answer should somehow be
evaluated, telling the user whether it was correct.
